                            Yoga?</b> </span><br><br>
                    Yoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating
                    mind, body, and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is
                    normally
                    thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. <br> The
                    different
                    paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques but ultimately lead to the same goal of
                    unification and enlightenment.Hatha Yoga attains the union of mind-body-spirit through a practice of
                    asanas
                    (yoga postures), pranayama (yoga breathing), mudra (body gestures), and shatkarma (internal
                    cleansing).
                    <br>
                    These physical practices are used to purify the body and cultivate prana (life-force energy). Modern
                    Hatha
                    Yoga does not emphasize many of these esoteric practices and instead focuses more on the physical
                    yoga
                    postures.

                <h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">What Is the Best Yoga for Beginners?</h2>
                <p>f you are out of shape or extremely inflexible, we recommend you begin with a gentle practice until
                    you
                    have built up the strength and flexibility for more challenging sequences. If you are a relatively
                    fit
                    and flexible person, you should be able to jump right into a regular hatha yoga class. Once you are
                    familiar with the basic postures, you can explore a vinyasa or flow class. We recommend you avoid
                    Ashtanga, Bikram, or hot yoga until you have built up some physical strength and endurance. It is
                    always
                    best to error on the side of caution and safety and approach yoga slowly and carefully.The best way
                    to
                    know if yoga is for you is to give it a try!</p><br><br>
                <h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">Is Yoga Right for You?</h2>
                <p>Yoga is in no way exclusive—being able to practice yoga does not matter how old you are, how much you
                    weigh, what you do for a living, where you live, or what religion you practice. Yoga is accessible
                    for
                    just about everyone. <br> <br> If you have a medical condition or a recent injury, it can be
                    challenging
                    or dangerous to do certain types of yoga, specific poses, or breathing techniques. Usually, there
                    are
                    alternatives or modifications that can allow you to practice safely, and many common complaints have
                    specific yoga therapy remedies. If you are recovering from an injury or are in poor health, we
                    recommended consulting with a physician or other qualified health care professional before beginning
                    yoga. <br> <br>While you may feel some intensity in the belly of your muscles while in a yoga pose,
                    you
                    should never feel pain, especially in the joints. A sharp or intense pain is your body’s signal to
                    tell
                    you to stop, back off, and take it easy.</p>

                            Practice Yoga</b> </span><br><br>
                    Yoga is typically performed in bare feet on a sticky yoga mat with optional yoga props. The yoga
                    movements and poses require clothes that can stretch and move freely with your body. You can
                    purchase
                    clothing specifically designed for yoga practice, but you can probably put together a comfortable
                    outfit
                    from your existing wardrobe to get started. <br> <br> Yoga classes may use additional props, the
                    most
                    common being straps, blocks, blankets, and bolsters. You don’t need to purchase these right away as
                    you
                    can easily substitute these items with scarves or neckties, a stack of books, and pillows. If you
                    take
                    classes at a yoga studio, they will provide everything that you need. <br> <br>We recommend that you
                    start with a short and straightforward yoga session and slowly build up from there. Once you feel
                    comfortable with a few basic beginner yoga postures, you can incorporate them into a sequence and
                    continue to add more challenging poses. Make sure you learn and follow the essential components of a
                    yoga practice: breathing, meditation, intention, asanas, and relaxation.</p>
